That’s a whole lot of pizza. In 1889 a pizza maker from Naples named Raffaele Esposito, who some consider the father of modern pizza, created a pie to match the colors of the Italian flag for Queen Margherita. It was topped with cheese, tomato and basil. The most expensive pizza in the world costs $12,000. October is national Pizza month. There's a mathematical theorem named after pizza. Anchovies are the least favorite pizza topping in America.</marquee>
