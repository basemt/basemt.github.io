            That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has been 
            <br> from its beginning; the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. As the poet Ralph 
            <br> Angel puts it, <i>“The poem is an interpretation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdZ9weP5i68" target="_blank" class="text-rainbow-animation"><b>weird theatrical shit</b></i></a>.”

            <br> draw a circle around the action and observe it from outside the circle; in other words, 
            <br> self-consciousness is theatre.
