    <p class="p2">the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of endings:
    <br> no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it.</p>

    <span class="poetry">In Poetry</span>
    <div class="poetryhover">the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that 
        <br> we cannot even conceive of it. 
        <br>
        <br> not every poem is finished –
        <br>one poem is abandoned, 
        <br>another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, 
        <br>which may be an ending, but it is the ending 
        <br>of a poem without an end. </div>

    <div class="stickynote">
        The French poet and thinker, once said that 
        <br><b style="color:blue;"><i>no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely abandoned.</i></b>
        <br>
        <br>
        This saying is also attributed to
        <b>Stéphane Mallarmé</b>, for where quotations begin is 
        <br><b style="color:blue;"><i>in a cloud.</i></b>
        <br>
        <br>
        He also described his perception of first lines 
        <br> so vividly, and to my mind so accurately,
        <br> that I have never forgotten it:
        <br>
        <br><b style="color:blue;"><i>the opening line of a poem, he said, is like 
        <br>finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of 
        <br>fallen fruit you have never seen before, 
        <br> and the poet’s task is to create the tree 
        <br> from which such a fruit would fall.</i></b></div>

    <p class="p3">In the beginning was <b style="color:blue;">the Word.</b> Western civilization rests upon those 
        <br>words. And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in 
        <br>the beginning was <b style="color:blue;">the Act.</b> 
        <br>that <b style="color:blue;">nothing can precede action — </b> 
        <br>no <b style="color:blue;">breath</b> before act, 
        <br>no <b style="color:blue;">thought</b> before act, 
        <br>no <b style="color:red;">pervasive love</b> 
        <br>before some 
        <br>kind of 
        <br><b style="color:blue;">act.</b></p>

        <p class="p4">I <b style="color:blue;">believe</b> the poem is an act of <b style="color:red;">the mind.</b>
            <br>I think it is easier <b style="color:blue;">to talk</b> about the end of a poem 
            <br>than it is <b style="color:blue;">to talk</b> about its beginning. 
            <br>Because the poem <b style="color:blue;">ends on the page,</b>
            <br>but it <b style="color:blue;">begins off the page</b>, it <b style="color:red;">begins in the mind.</b> 
            <br>The mind <b style="color:blue;">acts</b>, the mind <b style="color:red;">wills</b> a poem, 
            <br>often <b style="color:blue;">against our own will</b>; 
            <br><b style="color:red;">somehow</b> this happens, <b style="color:red;">somehow</b> a poem gets written 
            <br><b style="color:blue;">in the middle of a chaotic holiday party</b>that has just run out of ice, 
            <br>and <b><u>it's your house.</b></u></p>
