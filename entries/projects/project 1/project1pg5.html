            I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea.
            <br>
            <br> Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for snow. 
            <br>
            <br>This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so constructed—English among them—that<b><i> we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime.</b></i>
            <br>
            <br>That sentence begins with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your last words right before you step into the limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. Or, if you are blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end.

            When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: <br>
            ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
            <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b><i>“That’s a lot of semicolons!”</b></i>
            <br> he is absolutely right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated.

            You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, what connects the first line to the last, the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. Between the first and last lines there exists—a poem—and if it were not for the poem that intervenes, the first and last lines of a poem would not speak to each other. 
<br>
<br>Would not speak to each other. Because <b><i>the lines of a poem are speaking to each other, not you to them or they to you.</i></b></div>

            I will tell you what I miss: I miss watching a movie and at the end, huge scrolled words come on the screen and say: <b><i>The End.</i></b> I miss finishing a novel and there on the last page, at a discrete distance from the last words of the last sentence, are the dark letters spelling <b><i>The End.</i></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore them, I read them, even if only silently, with a deep sense of feeling: both the feeling of being replete,
             a feeling of satisfaction, and the feeling of loss, the sadness of having finished the book.

             A Haiku is a poem focusing on a brief moment in time, it juxtaposes two images, and creates a sudden sense of enlightenment! A traditional Haiku consists of seventeen syllables, respectfully split into three lines of five, seven and five.
